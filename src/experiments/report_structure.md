- Useful things:
    -  If we are small group maybe only 2 medium/large datasets.
    - We have to perform a 10 cross validation experimento, get the particular accuracy for each of the split of the data, and then  provide the general accuracy (average) for all the 10 experiments.

- Time line plan:
    - Start (November 15th)
    - Prepare the cross validation code (get the 10 train and 10 test versions) ()
    - Implement k-nearest neighbors ()
    - Implement parameters of k-nearest neighbors ()
